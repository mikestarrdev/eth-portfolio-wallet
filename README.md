# ETH Wallet

# DESCRIPTION

The purpose of this project is to gain experience building with Ethers.js, React, and Solidity. I started it as a submission for ETHGlobal's HackMoney hackathon

# FEATURES

- Users can interact with the Uniswap v3 SwapRouter contract to send transactions and swap tokens through the DApp's UI
- Users can create a new wallet
- Users can send transactions over the Rinkeby test network by entering their mnemonic phrase (not secure!) into the UI
- Users can connect the DApp to their MetaMask wallet

# LICENSES

- This project is open source. Anybody is free to use the code and modify it as needed.
